## Purpose
End-to-end project bootstrap with clarification, architecture planning, implementation, testing, and delivery artifacts.

## Agent Routing
- planner
- researcher

## Execution Protocol
1. Ask clarifying questions unless user explicitly asks for autonomous mode.
2. Build phased plan and get approval.
3. Implement project structure and requested features.
4. Add tests and run quality checks.
5. Generate docs/plan summary and next milestones.

## Validation
- Verify assumptions before changing files.
- Run the smallest relevant checks first, then broader checks when risk is high.
- Report residual risks explicitly.

## Output Format
1. Finalized implementation plan
2. Files created/modified summary
3. Test results
4. Remaining TODOs
