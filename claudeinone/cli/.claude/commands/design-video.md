2. Extract timing/easing patterns.
3. Implement motion with reduced-motion support.

## Validation
- Verify assumptions before changing files.
- Run the smallest relevant checks first, then broader checks when risk is high.
- Report residual risks explicitly.

## Output Format
1. Motion spec
2. UI implementation
3. Accessibility notes
