# Bootstrap Auto Fast

## Invocation
`/bootstrap:auto:fast [desc]`

## Purpose
Speed-optimized autonomous bootstrap for rapid iteration.

## Agent Routing
- planner
- fullstack-developer
- tester

## Execution Protocol
1. Perform minimal research pass.
2. Prioritize a working end-to-end slice.
3. Implement directly with pragmatic defaults.
4. Run critical checks and report tradeoffs due to speed mode.

## Validation
- Verify assumptions before changing files.
- Run the smallest relevant checks first, then broader checks when risk is high.
- Report residual risks explicitly.

## Output Format
1. Working feature slice
2. Tests/checks run
3. Deferred hardening items
