## Invocation
`/plan [feature]`

## Purpose
Create implementation-ready plan before coding.

## Agent Routing
- researcher
- planner

## Execution Protocol
1. Run parallel research passes.
2. Synthesize architecture and phased tasks.
3. Save plan artifact in plans/.
4. Wait for review before implementation.

## Validation
- Verify assumptions before changing files.
- Run the smallest relevant checks first, then broader checks when risk is high.
- Report residual risks explicitly.

## Output Format
1. Plan file path
2. Phase breakdown
3. Risks and assumptions
