# Marketing Writing

## Overview
Write compelling marketing copy that converts visitors into users — landing pages, emails, and product messaging.

## Value Proposition Framework

```
Formula: [Product] helps [target audience] [do/achieve X] without [pain point].

Examples:
- "ClaudeInOne helps developers ship production-grade code faster without wasting time on boilerplate."
- "Resend helps developers send transactional emails that actually reach the inbox, without managing mail servers."
```

## Landing Page Structure

```markdown
# Hero Section
Headline: Bold claim that speaks to the #1 desire
Subheadline: Clarify how, for whom, and why it's different
CTA: Specific action button ("Start for free" > "Get started")

# Social Proof
- User count, company logos, ratings
- "Join 10,000+ developers" — specific numbers build trust

# Features → Benefits
Feature: "Real-time collaboration"
Benefit: "Ship features 3x faster with your whole team working together"
Rule: Every feature should have a "so you can..." benefit

# How It Works
3-step process — make it look easy

# Testimonials
Quote, name, company, photo — specific results preferred
"Reduced our deploy time from 2 hours to 15 minutes" > "Great tool!"

# Pricing
Clear tiers, highlight recommended plan, monthly/annual toggle

# FAQ
Address top 5 objections before they arise

# Final CTA
Repeat the main CTA with urgency or guarantee
```

## Email Subject Lines

```
Formulas that work:
- [Number] ways to [achieve goal]: "5 ways to reduce API latency"
- Question that challenges assumption: "Are your deployments still taking 30 minutes?"
- Urgency: "Your trial ends in 24 hours"
- Personal: "Quick question about your project, [first name]"
- Intrigue: "The mistake 90% of developers make"
```

## Microcopy Patterns

```tsx
// Empty states — tell users what to do, not what's missing
// BAD: "No projects found"
// GOOD: "Create your first project to get started"

// Buttons — action + context
// BAD: "Submit" / "OK" / "Yes"
// GOOD: "Create Project" / "Confirm Delete" / "Yes, cancel subscription"

// Error messages — tell users how to fix it
// BAD: "An error occurred"
// GOOD: "Your session expired. Sign in again to continue."

// Placeholder text — show the format, not just the label
// BAD: "Enter email"
// GOOD: "name@company.com"
```

## Best Practices
- Write to one person: "you" not "users"
- Specifics > generics: "saves 2 hours/day" > "saves time"
- Benefits > features: "ship faster" > "automated deployments"
- Address the top objection in your headline or first paragraph
