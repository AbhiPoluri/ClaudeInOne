# Coding Level

## Invocation
`/coding-level`

## Purpose
Set response depth/style for future coding interactions.

## Agent Routing
- project-manager

## Execution Protocol
1. Interpret requested verbosity level.
2. Confirm mode (terse/balanced/deep).
3. Apply to subsequent responses in session.

## Validation
- Verify assumptions before changing files.
- Run the smallest relevant checks first, then broader checks when risk is high.
- Report residual risks explicitly.

## Output Format
1. Active coding level
2. What changes in response style
